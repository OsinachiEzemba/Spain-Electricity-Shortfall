# Introduction
The Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge was a project aimed at analyzing and modeling the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and renewable sources in Spain. The project was conducted to provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of energy generation, with the ultimate goal of supporting the government's decision-making process regarding renewable energy infrastructure investments.

# Project Scope
The project involved the following key objectives:

1. Data Analysis: A comprehensive analysis of the supplied data was performed to understand its structure, identify potential errors or inconsistencies, and explore the relationships between variables.

2. Data Cleaning: Data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries, were addressed through a rigorous data cleaning process. This step ensured the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis and modeling stages.

3. Feature Engineering: Additional features were engineered to enrich the dataset and enhance the predictive power for forecasting three-hourly demand shortfalls. This involved transforming existing features, creating derived features, and considering relevant external data sources.

4. Model Building: Various machine learning models were developed and evaluated to forecast the energy shortfalls accurately. In this project, an AdaBoost model was trained and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance and predictive accuracy.

5. Model Evaluation: The performance of the developed model, along with other candidate models, was rigorously evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques. This step allowed for the selection of the best-performing model for deployment.

6. Feature Importance Analysis: A thorough analysis of feature importance was conducted to identify the key factors influencing the energy shortfalls. This analysis provided valuable insights into the most significant features driving the predictions and helped guide decision-making processes.

7. Model Explanation: The inner workings of the selected model were explained in a clear and concise manner to a non-technical audience. The explanation included insights into how the model made predictions, the importance of various features, and the factors contributing to the energy shortfall forecasts.

# Conclusion
The Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge project successfully achieved its objectives, providing valuable insights into the trends and patterns of energy generation in Spain. Through data analysis, rigorous data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building, an AdaBoost model was developed to accurately forecast three-hourly demand shortfalls. The project outcomes enabled informed decision-making regarding renewable energy infrastructure investments, supporting the government's efforts to promote sustainable energy sources in Spain.
